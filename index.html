            Basic literacy among children in South Africa has declined. A new report from the 2030 Reading Panel has found.
        </div>
        <div class="box gray">
            Most children leave grade one without knowing the alphabet, while 82% of grade 4 children cannot read for meaning.

        <div class="box yellow">
            Fewer primary school children can read for meaning now than before the COVID pandemic.
        </div>
        <div class="box blue">
            Meaning becomes familiar when the child can resonate with the environment. On a daily basis children are accustomed to certain jargon and lexicon based on familiarity.

        <h1>Why we offer what we offer</h1>
        <p>As we transition towards a different epoch in South Africa,<br>
            it becomes vital to teach young people about society and<br>
            more importantly the legal pillars that protect and<br> strengthen democracy</p><br>

            <p>We dare not fail the young because of the current epoch.<br>
            Children must understand the significance of the<br>
            democratic dispensation and its significance in shaping<br>
            society. Why people vote, why people petition, how people<br>
            must petition. What parliament and legislature mean.</p><br>
            <p>The democracy pack is a series of books for children <br>
                between 7 and 12 to teach about the basics concepts of <br>
                South African democracy.</p>
